    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Tortang talong is a Filipino eggplant omelette that delights
        the palate with its simplicity and rich flavors. Grilled
        eggplants are flattened, dipped in beaten eggs, and then fried to
        golden perfection. The resulting dish boast a smoky undertone from
        the charred eggplant, complemented by the savory blend of eggs.
        Often seasoned with salt and pepper, and occasionally enhanced
        with minced garlic or onions, tortang talong is a satisfying and
        versatile dish, served as a side, main course, or even as a filling 
        for sandwiches.

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Eggplant:</strong>
            <ul>
                Heat the eggplant directly over fire in a stovetop until
                the skin turns brown to black, rotate after a few minutes
                until all parts of are almost burnt. Then let the eggplant
                cool down and then peel of the skin using your fingers. The
                inside part of the eggplant should be steamed just right at 
                this point. Arrange the peeled eggplant in a plate and then
                flatten using a fork. Set aside.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Egg:</strong>
            <ul>
                Beat the egg in a bowl and add salt and pepper. Continue
                beating until the salt and pepper are well blended. Dip the
                eggplant in the mixture.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Oil:</strong>
            <ul>
                Heat oil in a pan. Once the oil gets hot, start to fry one side 
                of the eggplant until it gets medium brown. Pour the remaining 
                egg mixture on top of the eggplant. Turn it over and fry the
                other side until it gets light to medium brown. And don't forget to
                serve with banana ketchup.
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Tortang talong is a Filipino eggplant omelette that delights
        the palate with its simplicity and rich flavors. Grilled
        eggplants are flattened, dipped in beaten eggs, and then fried to
        golden perfection. The resulting dish boast a smoky undertone from
        the charred eggplant, complemented by the savory blend of eggs.
        Often seasoned with salt and pepper, and occasionally enhanced
        with minced garlic or onions, tortang talong is a satisfying and
        versatile dish, served as a side, main course, or even as a filling 
        for sandwiches.

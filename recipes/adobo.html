    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Adobo is a traditional Filipino dish known for its savory
        and slightly tangy flavor. It typically consists of meat 
        (chicken. pork, or a combination of both) narinated of soy
        sauce, vinegar, garlic, various spices. The marinated 
        meat is then simmered until tender, creating a rich and 
        flavorful dish that is enjoyed by many. The balance of 
        salty, sweet, and tangy flavors makes adobo a staple in
        Filipino cuisine.
